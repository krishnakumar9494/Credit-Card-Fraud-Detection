# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection using Machine Learning
Abstract 
Due to the increasing number of customers as well
as the increasing number of companies that use credit cards for
ending financial transactions, the number of fraud cases has
increased dramatically. Dealing with noisy and imbalanced data,
as well as with outliers, has accentuated this problem. In this
work, fraud detection using artificial intelligence is proposed.
The proposed system uses logistic regression to build the
classifier to prevent frauds in credit card transactions. To handle
dirty data and to ensure a high degree of detection accuracy, a
pre-processing step is used. The pre-processing step uses two
novel main methods to clean the data: the mean-based method
and the clustering-based method. Compared to two well-known
classifiers, the support vector machine classifier and voting
classifier, the proposed classifier shows better results in terms of
accuracy, sensitivity, and error rate.
